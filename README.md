# Martyisms

## Parenting

- Kids give you the opportunity to be proud of things you'd never be proud of yourself for. Nobody gets excited when I walk in a straight line or eat all of my broccoli.

## Technology

- Don't come to me with solutions. Come with problems.
- Security is not a problem until it's a problem.
- It's easy to make software for yourself. It's hard to make software for somebody else.
