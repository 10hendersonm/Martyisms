# Martyisms

## Parenting

<a href="#20-minutes" id="20-minutes">#</a> When you have a baby, everything magically gets 20 minutes further away. Wake the baby, feed the baby, change the baby, clothe the baby, load them into the car seat, get the diaper bag ready, ...  
How many things wouldn't you do if they were 20 minutes further away?

<a href="#im-not-drunk" id="im-not-drunk">#</a> Kids give you the opportunity to be proud of things you'd never be proud of yourself for. Nobody gets excited when I walk in a straight line or eat all of my broccoli.

## Process

<a href="#new-rules" id="new-rules">#</a> Don't change the rules in the middle of the game.

## Technology

<a href="#no-solutions" id="no-solutions">#</a> Don't come to me with solutions. Come with problems.

<a href="#security" id="security">#</a> Security is not a problem until it's a problem.

<a href="#shared-software" id="shared-software">#</a> It's easy to make software for yourself. It's hard to make software for somebody else.

<a href="#more-time-more-code" id="more-time-more-code">#</a> Everything is possible with more time and more code.

## Experience / Accomplishments

<a href="#experienced-enough-to-get-nothing-done" id="experienced-enough-to-get-nothing-done">#</a> The more experienced you get, the quicker you find problems within the solutions that you propose. Eventually, I'll be so experienced that I'll instantly talk myself out of any idea I have, and I'll cease to get anything done.

<a href="#things-that-dont-matter" id="things-that-dont-matter">#</a> It's easy to say that the things that you have don't matter.
